## Andrew Byrnes: Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Data Analyst

Hi Fetch Data Science & Analytics team,

I'm excited to share this repository as my submission for the Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Data Analyst.

- My answers to the exercise can be found in **2.2-FINAL_ANSWERS.ipynb**
  - This includes the ERD, queries to answer stakeholder questions, my evaluation of data quality, and a sample email communication 
- **1-Data_Prep.ipynb** captures my process of transforming the provided data into the fetch.db SQLite database.
- **2.1-EDA_first_pass.ipynb** could be considered as a draft of my final answers, it reflects my thought process as I explored this data

I've included my tech exercise submission for the Catalog Analyst role as a reference. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately!) the open roles had already been filled when I submitted my work. I'm grateful for it to have been reviewed anyway, and especially for the invitation to apply for this Data Analyst role. It can be found in ./reports/fetch_catalog_analyst_andrew_byrnes

My resume and cover letter for the Catalog Analyst role can be found in ./reports/fetch_catalog_analyst_andrew_byrnes/fetch_tech_challenge/application_artifacts. I share many of the same sentiments between the Catalog Analyst and Data Analyst role.

I completed this exercise little by little over the course of the last week, and really enjoyed the process. If this is representative of the what I'd be doing in this role, I think it would be rewarding work.

Thanks for your time, I appreciate your consideration.

-Andrew
