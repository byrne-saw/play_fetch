- there are dupicate values in brands.barcode, cannot assume unique values, will lead to duplicates in joins  
-  many reapeated values in users.id
- the barcodes in rewardsReceiptItemList and that whole set of data seems off after 2/26/21
  - actually it looks like barcode is not a good join point, should use brandcode maybe
- using the same process I did for sizes I can extract brands from descriptions
- there are two dupes in brands.brandCode - This needs to be accounted for when performing this join. If only brands.name is needed, a CTE selecting unique name, brandCode from brands would prevent duplicates.
