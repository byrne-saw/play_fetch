- there are dupicate values in brands.barcode, cannot assume unique values, will lead to duplicates in joins  
-  many reapeated values in users.id
- the barcodes in rewardsReceiptItemList and that whole set of data seems off after 2/26/21
  - actually it looks like barcode is not a good join point, should use brandcode maybe
- using the same process I did for sizes I can extract brands from descriptions
