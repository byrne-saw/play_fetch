Hi Fetch Catalog Team,

I'm excited to submit the technical challenge exercise for the Catalog Analyst role. This was the most enjoyable application activity I've ever completed. Assuming it's reflective of the type of work I would encounter in this role, it has increased my interest.

- My final answers can be found in the notebook located at ./fetch_tech_challenge/2.2-FINAL-ANSWERS.ipynb

- The SQLite database I created is located at ./fetch_tech_challenge/data/processed/catalog.db

- For reference I've included my resume and cover letter in ./fetch_tech_challenge/application_artifacts

If you have any troulbe accessing these files, please let me know at byrnesaw@gmail.com or 773-885-3893.

Thank you, I look forward to speaking with you soon.
